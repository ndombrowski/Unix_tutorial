# Unix_tutorial

You can find the html version of the tutorial [here](https://ndombrowski.github.io/Unix_tutorial).

Some test files to play with can be found in the Input_docs folder. 

Additionally, the raw rmd and hmtl files are provided in the main path as well.

Among others includes information on how to:

- Working with the terminal
- Connecting to servers
- Use basic unix commands, such as grep, sed, sort, ...
- Checking sequence quality
- Basic info for tools to run assemblies
- Basic info on tools to use to bin metagenome-assembled genomes
- Basic info on how to run tools for phylogenetic analyses
- Some of these commands use custom/public perl and python scripts, which will be uploaded later (or send me a mail). Please also note that this is code collected over the years and that code might not be completely up to date, so always validate carefully.
